// Paging for the list endpoints.
//
// Every list here was unbounded: a panel with ten thousand payment orders answered
// /v1/billing/orders with all of them, and the caller had no way to ask for less.
// That is a problem for an integration polling on a timer, and a worse one for an
// assistant, whose context the whole list has to fit into.
//
// The window is the same everywhere — ?limit and ?offset, with a "meta" block
// carrying the total — so a caller learns it once. Where a list was already paged
// (users, and the journals, which page by cursor because their rows shift), that
// shape is kept rather than a second one invented.

// defaultPageLimit is what a caller gets when they ask for no window at all.
//
// Not "everything": the point of this file is that an unbounded default is how a
// small integration works fine for a year and then times out. Callers who genuinely
// want the lot ask for it (limit<=0 is still honoured as "all remaining"), which is
// a deliberate act rather than an accident.

// maxPageLimit caps one response however large a limit is asked for. It bounds the
// memory a single request can cost the panel — and, for the assistant reading these
// through MCP, the context one call can consume.

// the nodes' link settings, the servers' custom inbounds and the external servers.
//
// Each fetch read all three from the store, the node list being a read of every node's
// settings, and those reads queue behind the one SQLite connection the whole panel
// shares. In the load test a burst of sixty fetches a second got through at thirty-seven
// while the CPU sat at 41%.
//
// One read now serves for subSharedTTL, and any request that may change something
// through the panel or the API makes the next one fresh (see notingWrites), so an
// operator's own edit reaches the next subscription. What moves on its own — a node's
// reported certificate or last sight, an external subscription's refresh — reaches
// subscriptions within the TTL; their clients refresh in hours.

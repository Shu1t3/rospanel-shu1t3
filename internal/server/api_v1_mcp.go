// The panel's own MCP endpoint, so an assistant can be pointed at a URL instead of
// being handed a binary to run. Same protocol as `rospanel mcp`, same tool list —
// only the transport differs: JSON-RPC over HTTPS (MCP's "Streamable HTTP") rather
// than over a pipe.
//
// Two things are unusual and deliberate:
//
//   - The key rides in the PATH, not in a header. The dialogs that add a remote MCP
//     server take a URL and nothing else, so a header-only credential cannot be
//     entered at all. The panel already builds every public surface this way — the
//     subscription token, the node segment, the payment-webhook secret — and the URL
//     is therefore exactly as secret as the key inside it. Treat it like a password.
//   - One address per key, and the key's role decides the toolbox: the assistant is
//     offered exactly the tools behind routes the role can call. A read-only
//     assistant is a key with a read-only role — the decision lives where every other
//     permission does, not in which of two URLs was pasted.
const mcpPathPrefix = "/v1/mcp/"

// maxMCPResult bounds what one tool call hands back.
//
// The unit that matters is the model's context, not disk: half a megabyte of JSON is
// already on the order of a hundred thousand tokens, which is most of a large
// context window spent on one call. It sits well above the window below (50 users
// with their share links is ~100 KB), so in normal use it never bites; what it stops
// is `limit=0` on a panel with thousands of rows silently filling the conversation.
//
// Measure before changing it. A user row is ~2 KB — the REST maximum of a thousand
// of them is 2 MB and cannot be made to fit by raising a ceiling.
const maxMCPResult = 512 << 10

// mcpListDefaultLimit is the window a list call gets when the assistant asked for
// none. The REST default of 100 suits an integration writing rows into a database;
// it does not suit a caller that pays for every row in context. An explicit limit
// still wins — `limit<=0`, meaning everything, included: a caller that means it can
// still say so, and the ceiling above is what catches them if they were wrong.

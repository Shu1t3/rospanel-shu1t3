// A node's report is taken on trust in what it says about whom: traffic, connections
// and destinations each name a user. A node the operator no longer controls could name
// anyone — spend a stranger's quota, push them over their device limit, get their
// address banned fleet-wide, have them cut off for "abuse", start a held term. So a
// node is believed only about the users its config lets in: the ones the panel gave
// it. What it can still do to those, it could do by serving them badly anyway.

// nodeServedGrace is how long a user who has left a node's config is still believed
// in its reports. The push that removes someone is built before the node applies it,
// and what they used until then arrives on the node's next syncs — or, after an
// outage between the two, with its backlog.

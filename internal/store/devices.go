// RegisterDevice admits a client install to a user's device roster, enforcing the

// The check and the insert MUST NOT be separate statements. Two clients fetching at
// once against a full-but-one roster would both read "one slot left" and both take
// it — the bug Remnawave shipped and had to issue an advisory for
// (GHSA-985p-44h5-v3pq). Here the cap lives inside the INSERT's WHERE clause, so
// SQLite's single writer serialises the two attempts and the second one inserts zero
// rows.
//
// limit 0 means unlimited. An already-bound device always passes: the cap governs
// how many devices exist, not how often they refresh.
// maxDevicesPerUser mirrors model.MaxDevicesPerUser. It is applied here as well as in
// Settings.DeviceCap so a direct store caller (a test, a future job) cannot bypass the
// ceiling by passing 0 — the roster is written from an unauthenticated fetch, so this is
// the last line rather than the only one.

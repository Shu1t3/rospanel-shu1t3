// Admin is a panel account.

// A role is a named set of permissions (see perms.go). Two roles ship with every
// panel — "admin" and "operator", the rungs of the ladder this replaced — and the
// owner adds their own. The owner is not a role in that table: they hold every
// permission implicitly, and a check against an unknown role key resolves to no
// permissions at all — a row with a corrupt role is powerless, not omnipotent.

)

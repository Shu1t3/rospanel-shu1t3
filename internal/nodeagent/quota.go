// The node samples its traffic about once a minute, and the panel counts it against
// users' quotas only when a report arrives: a user downloading through a node went on
// for up to two minutes past their quota before the panel knew. Sampling more often
// would make every sync carry traffic and every sync a database write on the panel.
//
// Instead the panel answers each sync with what the users active here have left, and
// every quotaTickEvery the agent reads its Xray's counters and adds up what the panel
// has not seen yet — traffic not sampled, sampled but not sent, sent but not
// acknowledged. A user past what they had left gets a sample and a report straight
// away, marked so the panel enforces it at once; the connections they hold are closed
// when the panel's removal arrives. A user who starts using the node cuts the poll's
// wait, so what they have left arrives within a tick rather than a hold.

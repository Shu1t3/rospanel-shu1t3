// Per-user speed caps on a node.
//
// The node shapes its own traffic: the panel sends WHO is capped and by how much
// (NodeMeta.SpeedLimits), and the node pairs that with its own access-log tap,
// which is the only place that knows the addresses those users reach THIS server
// from. Sending the master's address view instead would cap addresses that never
// touch this node and miss the ones that do.

// shapeSightingTTL is how long an address keeps a user shaped after their last
// connection through this node. Matches the panel-side window: a cap must not lapse
// because a client paused a download.
const shapeSightingTTL = 10 * time.Minute

// shapeInterval is how often the tree is recomputed. Applying is skipped when the
// state is unchanged, so an idle node does nothing but walk a small map.

// maxTrackedAddrs bounds how many addresses one user is tracked on. Larger than
// what is shaped (below) so a roaming client's history isn't thrown away, small
// enough that a forged-email flood can't grow the map.

// seenAddrs remembers which addresses each user has been seen on recently.
//
// Separate from the agent's `conns` buffer even though both are fed by the same
// callback: that one is drained on every sync (it is a report), while this one has
// to keep answering "where is this user now" between syncs. Draining it would take

// This file is the outbound-proxy half of the package: an operator-configured proxy
// for reaching a host the server otherwise cannot.
//
// It lives next to the SSRF guards rather than in internal/telegram (its only
// caller today) for two reasons: core needs the same parser to validate the setting
// and cannot import telegram — that dependency is deliberately one-way — and
// building outbound HTTP clients is already this package's job.
//
// Note the different threat models. The guards in fetch.go exist because a fetch
// TARGET can be attacker-influenced, so it is resolved and checked against private
// ranges. A proxy address is not: it is typed by an authenticated admin, and the
// likeliest value is a loopback or LAN address — a SOCKS inbound on the same box.
// So a proxy is never subjected to rejectPrivateIP; doing so would reject the
// normal case.

// ProxySchemes are the proxy URL schemes supported. All four are handled by
// net/http itself; nothing here implements a proxy protocol.
//
// socks5 and socks5h are both accepted and behave identically: Go's SOCKS5 dialer
// always sends the hostname for the proxy to resolve, which is what the "h" asks
// for. Both are listed because operators paste whichever their proxy documented.

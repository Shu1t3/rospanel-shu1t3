// Package mcp exposes the panel's REST API to an AI assistant over the Model
// Context Protocol.
//
// It is a thin translator, not a second API: every tool is one operation from the
// generated OpenAPI document, and calling one is dispatched against the panel's own
// REST surface with the caller's API key. Nothing here can do anything a key holder
// could not do with curl — which is the point, because an assistant is exactly the
// kind of caller whose reach should be bounded by a credential rather than by its
// manners.
//
// Two things are deliberate:
//
//   - The tool list is DERIVED from the OpenAPI spec the panel already generates
//     from its route table, so a new endpoint appears here without anyone
//     remembering to add it, and a removed one disappears.
//   - Write operations are off unless asked for. An assistant that misreads a
//     sentence can delete a user, and "it had a key" is no comfort afterwards.
//
// The panel serves this over HTTPS itself (internal/server/api_v1_mcp.go). There is
// no separate binary to run: an assistant is pointed at a URL.

// Handler answers plain HTTP on port 80: ACME challenges are served, and
// everything else is sent to HTTPS.
//
// The point is what port 80 looks like when nothing is there. A host that answers
// 443 with a convincing website and refuses 80 outright is not a shape the real web
// has — essentially every site that serves HTTPS also answers HTTP and redirects —
// so the refusal itself says "this is not what it claims to be", however good the
// page on 443 is.
//
// The redirect imitates the same server the decoy claims to be, down to the status
// code: Caddy answers its automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect with 308 and an empty body,
// where nginx would use 301. Claiming to be Caddy on 443 and redirecting like nginx
// on 80 is the same contradiction one layer down.
//
// host is the one name this machine answers to. The redirect goes there and not to
// whatever Host the request carried: 443 already refuses an SNI it cannot serve, so a
// port 80 that echoes any hostname back contradicts the port beside it and marks this
// as a catch-all redirector rather than a configured site. A single-site server
// sending everything to its own name is entirely ordinary. It also means no one can
// make this panel emit a Location pointing at a host of their choosing.
//
// Empty host (a first boot before the wizard has run) falls back to echoing, because
// there is nothing else to point at.
//
// Read per request rather than captured once: an operator who points a new domain at
// the box changes it without restarting anything, and a redirect still naming the old
// one is the same contradiction this exists to remove.
